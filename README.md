# Project Title: Thermography_for_Grape_Mortality

Our technology aims to mitigate the significant financial losses caused by mistakenly cutting off healthy grape buds in the Northeast US during winter and early spring. We used a thermal camera (FLIR a700) to capture thousands of thermal images of the grape buds and used controllable heating to differentiate between live and dead buds based on temperature changes. By analyzing the image data with computer vision and machine learning, we were able to develop a successful identification model with an accuracy of around 90%. My role in the project involved acquiring data from the thermal camera, using computer vision to isolate the grape buds, and training the model to detect dead buds. A successful outcome of the project would be a trained model that can accurately identify dead buds among a group of grape buds, thereby reducing economic losses in the field.
