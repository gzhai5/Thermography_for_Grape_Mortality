# Active Thermography for Non-Destructive Determination of Bud Mortality for Grapes

This repository contains the complete research codebase and data organization for a two-part study on **non-destructive grape-bud mortality assessment** using an **engineered active thermography system** and **machine learning models**.

The research is presented as **two independent but connected manuscripts**, each with its own scope, methods, and reproducible pipelines.

## 📄 Manuscripts Overview

### 📘 Manuscript I — Active Thermography System Design and Capability
**Focus:**  
Design and validation of an active thermography system for grape-bud viability assessment, including experimental protocols and data preprocessing.

➡️ **Detailed documentation:**  
📂 [`manuscript1_system/README.md`](manuscript1_system/README.md)

## 🔁 Reproducibility & Design Philosophy

- Clear separation between **data acquisition** and **modeling**
- Independent but compatible pipelines for each manuscript
- Seed-controlled experiments with repeated runs
- Deployment-oriented evaluation across multiple metrics
